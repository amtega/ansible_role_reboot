# Ansible reboot role

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) role which provides handlers to reboot machines.

## Requirements

[Ansible 2.7+](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)

## Variables

A list of all the default variables for this role is available in `defaults/main.yml`.

## Handlers

The role provides the following handlers to manage the host reboot:

- `reboot host`: reboot the host
- `wait host`: wait for the host to be rebooted

## Dependencies

## Usage

This is an example playbook:

```yaml
---

- hosts: all
  roles:
    - amtega.reboot
  tasks:
    - name: Create file and reboot
      copy:
        content: ""
        dest: /tmp/emptyfile1
        force: no
      notify:
        - reboot
        - reboot wait

    - meta: flush_handlers
```

## Testing

Tests are based on docker containers. You can setup docker engine quickly using the playbook `files/setup.yml` available in the role [amtega.docker_engine](https://galaxy.ansible.com/amtega/docker_engine).

Once you have docker, you can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
$ cd amtega.reboot/tests
$ ansible-playbook main.yml
```
